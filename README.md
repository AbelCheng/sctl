# Silverlight Continuation Tasks Library
The Silverlight Continuation Tasks Library provides a simplification to chain a continuation of asynchronous tasks, on completion, to invoke a second task ... one after another to any arbitrary length. The purpose of this library is to reduce Silverlight code from verbose asynchronous callback event handling.
